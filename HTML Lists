Your wedding party (also known as the bridal party) will include not only the people who will help you plan your big day, but they also are those you will want by your side when you walk down the aisle and say your vows. Typically your wedding party is made up of your sisters, brothers and closest friends or family members. This page will serve as a guide to share all of the duties, roles and responsibilities that are involved for each participant of the wedding party.

    <p>An engagement party is a party held to celebrate a couple's recent engagement and to help future wedding guests to get to know one another. Traditionally, the bride's parents host the engagement party, but many modern couples host their own celebration.</p>
